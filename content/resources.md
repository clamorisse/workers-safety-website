# Public Legal Education

The WHSLC has developed a strong focus on public legal education by way of oral presentations and workshops to community agencies, schools, job connection programs, apprenticeship programs and employment readiness programs such as Enhanced Language Training. 

Our Community Legal Workers travel all over the City of Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area to inform youth, job seekers and newcomers about employment rights as well as health and safety rights at work. We serve as a resource to many vulnerable groups and are often part of a newcomer’s or youth’s first introduction to Ontario’s employment laws and Legal Aid Ontario's clinic system. The workshops provide the public with legal information regarding employment standards, occupational health and safety, human rights and the legal aid system.

We facilitate 2-hour, free workshops in person and provide printed materials and resources to the participants.

The following workshops are available:

1. **Employment Rights at Work** – We discuss what legal aid is, how to access legal aid; Employment standards (minimum wage, overtime, public holiday pay, vacation and termination pay, etc.); the Ontario Human Rights Code; and health and safety rights under the *Occupational Health and Safety Act*. Additionally, we touch upon what happens when an individual gets injured at work and how to refuse unsafe work.

2. **Health and Safety Rights at Work** – In this talk, we discuss the *Occupational Health and Safety Act*; we provide an overview of WHMIS 1988 and its current transition to WHMIS 2015; the Ontario Human Rights Code; and workplace harassment and workplace violence. Additionally, we touch upon what happens when an individual gets injured at work and how to refuse unsafe work.
